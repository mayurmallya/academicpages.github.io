Welcome to my e-home!
=====

Hi, I'm an MSc student and a Research Assistant at the [Medical Image Analysis Lab](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) at the Simon Fraser University, Burnaby. My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning, particularly on images and graphs.

(My e-home is still under construction. Need time-loans...)
