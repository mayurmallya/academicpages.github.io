Hi. Welcome to my homepage!
=====

I'm a first-year MSc student and a Research Assistant at the [Medical Image Analysis Lab](https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/) at the Simon Fraser University, Burnaby. My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning particularly on images and graphs.
